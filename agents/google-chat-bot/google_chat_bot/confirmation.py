"""Google Chat confirmation flow for guarded tools.

When a guarded tool fires, ``google_chat_confirmation`` short-circuits the
call, appends a Card v2 to a request-scoped buffer, and records the pending
action in a ``ConfirmationStore``. The handler returns the buffered card as
part of the synchronous webhook response — no Chat REST client needed. When
the user clicks Approve/Deny the handler marks the matching pending as
approved (or pops it on deny) and re-enters the runner with a synthetic
user message that includes the original arguments. On the retry the
callback consults the store and consumes the approved entry by
``(thread, tool_name, args_hash)`` — so the handshake survives an ADK
``AgentTool`` sub-agent that does not propagate per-call state to the
parent session.

This mirrors the Slack bot's confirmation pattern so operators see a
consistent UX across transports.
