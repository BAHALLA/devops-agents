# Google Chat Bot Integration

![Google Chat Demo](../images/google-chat-demo.png){ align=right width="400" }

The Orrery platform ships a Google Chat integration that supports **thread-based session isolation**, **email-based RBAC**, and **Quick Command-driven Approve/Deny flows** for guarded tools.

Google Chat supports two ways of connecting to your bot. Choose the one that best fits your infrastructure:

    subgraph PS["Pub/Sub Pull — private network friendly"]

    end
```

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-webhook:{ .lg .middle } __[HTTP Webhook Setup](google-chat-webhook.md)__

    ---

    Standard connection for bots with a public URL (Ingress, Cloud Run, ngrok). Lowest latency.

-   :material-swap-horizontal:{ .lg .middle } __[Pub/Sub Setup](google-chat-pubsub.md)__

    ---

    Ideal for private networks (GKE). Bot pulls events from a queue; no public ingress required.

## Shared Concepts

Regardless of the transport you choose, the following concepts apply to all Google Chat deployments.

### Async Response Mode

Google Chat enforces a **~30 second synchronous budget** on webhook responses. If an agent run exceeds this budget, the UI will show an error. Orrery solves this with **Async Response Mode**:

1.  **Immediate Ack**: The bot returns a `200 OK` (empty `hostAppDataAction`) immediately.
2.  **Progress card posted**: A live "🔍 Investigating…" Card v2 is posted to the thread via the Chat REST API.
3.  **Background run**: The agent run proceeds. As sub-agents report in, the bot **PATCHes the same card in place** (`spaces.messages.patch` with `updateMask=cardsV2`) — no thread spam.
4.  **Final result**: On completion, the progress card is replaced with the final reply (see *Progressive Cards* below).

This mode is enabled by default (`GOOGLE_CHAT_ASYNC_RESPONSE=true`).

### Progressive Cards

For long-running investigations (incident triage, remediation loops), the bot streams progress live by updating a single message in place. The user sees the run evolve instead of staring at a blank thread for 60–120s.

**What the progress card shows:**

-   **Current step** — the friendly label for the executing sub-agent (e.g. `Checking Kafka`, `Synthesizing findings`).
-   **Tool breadcrumb** — the most recent tool call (`list_consumer_groups`, `get_pods`, …) so operators can see what the agent is doing right now.
-   **Subsystem chips** — one row per health-check subsystem that has reported in, with a severity icon inferred from the status text:
    -   ✅ `ok` · ⚠️ `warn` (yellow/degraded/lag) · ❌ `fail` (red/critical/crashloop) · ⏳ `pending`
-   **Remediation panel** (when `remediation_pipeline` is running) — shows `remediation_action` → `verification_result` → `remediation_summary` as the `LoopAgent` iterates.
-   **Elapsed seconds** — visible forward-progress signal.

Card updates are **debounced at 800ms** and **force-flushed** on each subsystem status write to balance liveness against Chat's update quota.

**Final result card (triage runs):**

When the run writes `kafka_status` / `k8s_status` / `docker_status` / `observability_status` / `elasticsearch_status` / `triage_report` into session state (i.e. `incident_triage_agent` ran), the progress card is replaced with a structured **Triage Report** card:

-   **Header** — overall severity badge: 🟢 *All systems healthy* / 🟡 *Degraded* / 🔴 *Critical*.
-   **Subsystem sections** — one section per subsystem with an icon and short summary.
-   **Summary** — the `triage_summarizer` output.
-   **"Remediate" Quick Command instruction** — when overall severity is `warn` or `fail` **and** the viewer is an `operator` or `admin`, the card invites the user to send the **Remediate** Quick Command, which fires the `remediation_pipeline` in the same session and reuses the triage report already in state. RBAC is still enforced server-side at tool time — the prompt is just a UI hint.

For non-triage queries (e.g. *"what's the Kafka lag?"*), no subsystem chips land, so the progress card falls back to a plain text/markdown final reply and the remediation hint is not shown.

**Failure modes handled:**

-   If `update_message` hits 404/410 (message deleted), subsequent updates are skipped silently.
-   If a later update fails for another reason, the final reply falls back to a fresh `create_message` so the user still gets a result.
-   If the agent run raises, the progress card is overwritten with an error card — never left stuck on "Investigating…".

### Authentication for Async Replies

Posting async replies requires a credential bearing the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` scope.

-   **Local Dev**: You **must** use a Service Account JSON key. `gcloud auth login` cannot obtain this scope.
-   **Production (GKE)**: Use **Workload Identity**. Leave `GOOGLE_CHAT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` unset and the bot will use ADC.

```bash
# Required for local dev
GOOGLE_CHAT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=/path/to/key.json
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Identity is resolved from the user's verified email address.

| Role | Access | How to grant |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `viewer` | Read-only tools | Default |
| `operator` | Read + `@confirm` tools | Add email to `GOOGLE_CHAT_OPERATOR_EMAILS` |
| `admin` | All tools | Add email to `GOOGLE_CHAT_ADMIN_EMAILS` |

### Interactive Guardrails

When an agent attempts a tool marked `@confirm` or `@destructive`, the bot posts a **Card v2** describing the action (level, reason, arguments) and instructs the operator to send the **Approve** or **Deny** Quick Command. The agent run is paused until a human responds.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Operator
    participant B as Orrery bot
    participant LLM as ADK Runner
    participant T as Guarded tool

    LLM->>T: patch_deployment(args)
    T->>B: confirmation_required (callback short-circuit)
    B->>U: Card v2 — DESTRUCTIVE: patch_deployment<br/>Send `Approve` or `Deny`
    U->>B: /Approve  (Quick Command, appCommandId=1)
    B->>B: mark_latest_approved_for_thread<br/>(args + args_hash + thread)
    B->>LLM: synthetic prompt with original args
    LLM->>T: patch_deployment(args)
    T->>B: callback consults store →<br/>consume_approved(thread, tool, args_hash)
    T->>LLM: success
    LLM->>U: "Patch was successful."
```

**Why Quick Commands instead of inline buttons?** Quick Commands ride the standard MESSAGE delivery path, so the bot receives a normal `appCommandPayload` event regardless of whether it's deployed as a standard Chat app or a Workspace Add-on. Inline `invokedFunction` buttons proved fragile across Add-on configurations.

**Two Quick Commands must be configured in the Chat API console** (one-time setup):

| Command ID | Name | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `1` | `Approve` | Approve user action with orrery chat agent |
| `2` | `Deny` | Deny user action with orrery chat agent |

Both must be of type **Quick command**.

**How the handshake survives across sub-agents.** Many guarded tools (`patch_deployment`, `restart_deployment`, …) live on specialist `AgentTool`-wrapped agents. ADK gives those AgentTool invocations their own ephemeral session, so any per-context retry flag the callback might write would be invisible to the next invocation. The bot keeps the approval handshake on its own `ConfirmationStore` instead, matching `(thread_or_space, tool_name, args_hash)` against entries the click handler has flipped to `approved=True`. The match is one-shot (consumed on retry) and is only valid for **120 seconds** after the Approve click — a stale approval can't auto-execute a later request.

**Argument fingerprinting.** The store hashes the canonical JSON of the tool's arguments. If the LLM, on retry, calls the tool with even slightly different arguments than were shown on the approval card, the hash won't match and the bot re-prompts with a fresh card. Operators authorize specific arguments, not just a tool name.

**Validity window.** Approvals expire 120s after the click. Pending entries expire 300s after creation. Both are enforced at lookup time and pruned opportunistically.

## Workspace Add-ons Mode

If your bot is a **Google Workspace Add-on**, it uses a different event structure and requires response wrapping. Orrery detects this automatically and uses the `hostAppDataAction` schema.

!!! note "Service Agent Identity"
    Add-on tokens are signed by a project-specific service agent. Add it to your `.env`:
    `GOOGLE_CHAT_IDENTITIES=chat@system.gserviceaccount.com,service-<PROJECT_NUMBER>@gcp-sa-gsuiteaddons.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

---

## Troubleshooting

-   **401 Unauthorized**: Check your `GOOGLE_CHAT_AUDIENCE` (must match console exactly) and `GOOGLE_CHAT_IDENTITIES`.
-   **403 Forbidden**: Your Service Account lacks the "Chat Bot API" or the `chat.bot` scope.
-   **404 Not Found**: The bot couldn't resolve the space name from the event.
